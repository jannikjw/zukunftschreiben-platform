# Final Assignment

## Project View Page for Zukunftsschreiben

The aim of this project is to develop a web app for Zukunftsschreiben (ZS) on 
which ongoing projects can be displayed, so that people willing to support 
(donate) ZS can see where there support goes into.

A stretch goal is to allow people to directly donate on the page.

This Project is being developed as part of the Web Development Elective at the 
Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM).
